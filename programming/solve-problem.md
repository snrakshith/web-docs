# Solve Problem :

It has 3 stages

- Input Phase
  - `Data Store`
  - `Input from other output`
- Functionality Phase
  - `Core Functionality to solve an issue`
- Output Phase
  - `Formatting`
  - `Different ways to export the code`

---

# Remember

- Just implement and it should just solve the problem.
- Refactor the code

  - `Functional` ( About the core functionality of the APP )

    - Look out for an alternative implementation of the previous solution.
    - May be use a different 3rd party library with a better API Exposure.
      - Think about `SQA` ( Software Quality Assurance )
    - The `new code` should be backward compactiable with the previous version.
    - Be `modular` in design.

  - `Non Functional` ( It's about Bigger Picture )
    - Size
    - Performance
    - Consistency in the Code
      - In using the `meaningful naming conventions`
      - `DRY Principle`
      - Add in required `Debugging` and `console.log()` statements.
