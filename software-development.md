# Software Development Process:

```
JamBoard :
 A simple white board where you stack up any random idea's.
```

### Mainly `2 Process` to develop software:

- Scrum
- Kanban

---

### Why these 2 process:

- bcz they provide a constant structure at organisational level.

---

## Keywords:

- `Flow`
- `Cards`
- `Workflow`
- `Lead Time`
- `WIP Limit`
- `Product Backlog`
- `Refactory Period`
- `Daily Active User's ( DAU's )`

---

### !! Remember:

- In case of
  - `Scrum` it is Scrum Master
  - `Kanban` it is Agile Coach

---

### Both the Methodology are `Pull Systems` ( Helps in getting the features from the `product backlog` to `customers` easily )

### Look to the `left` and `pull cards` from `( Left to Rigth )`

- Scrum works in `series of sprints` ( 2 weeks in duration )
- Features and User Stories.

## Kanban

- Kanban is a work management system, designed to help you visualise your work limit work in progress and maximise efficiency which we call as `flow`.
- `Setup of Kanban Process`
  - Kanban Board
  - Kanban Cards
  - Setup WIP Limit
- If columns are empty we call them, that they have `Bandwidth`.
- `Flow` works from `Backlog` to `Done`.
- `Workflow`
  - The purpose of the `kanban boards` is to categorise all the stages of work that a `work item` flows through from something you haven't `started` to `something that's done`.

---

## Kanban Cards

- `1 Kanban Card per user story` or `1 Kanban Card per work item.`
- Create a card and place them in the appropriate stage of the - workflow.
- `Kanban Cards should have a`
  - Title
  - Owner
  - Due Date
  - Descriptiion
  - Add any other helpfull info
- A card should gain a `little bit history`.
- A team leaves update's on the card as it moves from `one stage` of the `workflow to the other stage`.
- `Kanban Card's` should be small enough that the team can make progress on them in a reasonable amount time.
- `A Card should not be as big as it will take weeks to move the card forward nor small too.`
- The columns that starts to bunch up creating a bottle neck in your workflow.
- And also realise what size of cards, can be moved in a timely manner.
  - `( These efficiencies we call flow )`
